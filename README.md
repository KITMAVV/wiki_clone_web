### My Thoughts

I am proud of this project and our great team (even though there were fewer of us than planned).
We spent 3 months creating it, and in principle I like everything about it. Some features were never added, but the main features were, so you can use this code to make a wiki-clone that works.


### Backedn

Here's a link to my colleague **Sergei's** backend repository: [wikitravel-backend](https://github.com/SergeiBereka/wikitravel-backend.git).

#### **Working version of the backend used in the frontend is in the main branch (a newer version of the backend can be found in the master branch).*
